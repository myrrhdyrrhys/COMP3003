Software Engineering Concepts (Year 2, Semester 2)

One of the last units you are supposed to do in the SE degree offered at Curtin, which I had to take early due to complications with my timetable. The unit teaches advanced software architectural and design concepts, such as the development of multithreaded design structures, build engineering, the integration of multiple languages into a single application and the design and implementation of domain specific languages. This unit felt like quite the leap for me from those previous in terms of difficulty, however I enjoyed it for the most part for the interesting concepts that were introduced to me. 

I did unfortunately fail on the final assessment of the unit which involved parsing a domain specific language and implementing plugins for a text-editor app (among smaller other tasks), however I've included the mid-semester assessment which I did receive a pass for, centered more around the multithreading side of things by asking us to make a program to compare the similarity of two text files and display the results. Refer to the README.txt file in the repository for how to run the program.
